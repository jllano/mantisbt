			<listitem>
				<para>Master salt value used for cryptographic hashing
					throughout MantisBT. This value must be kept secret at
					all costs. You must generate a unique and random salt
					value for each installation of MantisBT you control.
					The minimum length of this string must be at least 16
					characters.
				</para>
				<para>The value you select for this salt should be a long
					string generated using a secure random number
					generator. An example for Linux systems is:
				</para>
				<para>cat /dev/urandom | head -c 64 | base64</para>
				<para>Note that the number of bits of entropy per byte of
					output from /dev/urandom is not 8. If you're
					particularly paranoid and don't mind waiting a long
					time, you could use /dev/random to get much closer to
					8 bits of entropy per byte. Moving the mouse
					(if possible) while generating entropy via /dev/random
					will greatly improve the speed at which /dev/random
					produces entropy.
				</para>
				<para>This setting is blank by default. MantisBT will not
					operate in this state. Hence you are forced to change
					the value of this configuration option.
				</para>
				<warning>
					<para>WARNING: This configuration option has a profound
						impact on the security of your MantisBT
						installation. Failure to set this configuration
						option correctly could lead to your MantisBT
						installation being compromised. Ensure that this
						value remains secret. Treat it with the same
						security that you'd treat the password to your
						MantisDB database.
